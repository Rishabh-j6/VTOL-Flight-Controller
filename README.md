# VTOL Flight Controller

## Overview
This repository contains the firmware and hardware designs for building a flight controller for a VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) plane. The controller is based on **Teensy** and uses sensors like **IMU, GPS, Barometer** for stabilization, control, and flight modes.

## Features
- Sensor integration (IMU, GPS, Barometer)
- PID control for stabilization
- Support for VTOL flight modes (hover, transition, forward flight)

## Folder Structure
- `hardware/`: Circuit diagrams and components
- `firmware/`: The main flight control software
- `simulations/`: Simulations for tuning and testing
- `logs/`: Flight test logs and debug information
- `docs/`: Project-related documentation

## Setup & Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VTOL-Flight-Controller.git
